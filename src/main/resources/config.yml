#Configuration File for PlayerStatistics
#Developed by dehys and OverDodo

#The PlayerStatisticsLib allows for plugin developers to work with a lot of different statistics.
#Unlike the Statistics included in Spigot, this library is not bound to worlds or in fact any folder
#Instead, PlayerStatisticsLib utilizes MySQL for saving data, which also allows for administrators to access the statistics
#outside of the server. It also allows for administrators to modify the statistics if necessary.

# prefix: a prefix the plugin will use for all internal and external messages
prefix: "&7[&bPlayerStatistics&7] "

sql:
  # host: the host address of your sql server (if hosted on same device: localhost)
  host: "localhost"

  # database: the name of the database the plugin is supposed to use
  database: "playerstatistics"

  # username: the name of the sql user.
  username: "root"

  # password: the password of the sql user
  password: "verysecurepassword"

savedata:
  # period: the delay between each time the plugin saves all cached data to the sql database (in seconds)
  period: 600

  # clearcache: if set to true, every time all cached data is saved to the sql database, the cache will be cleared
  # useful for servers with a higher player count
  clearcache: true

statistics:
  # enabled: if set to false, disables the tracking of certain statistics
  # useful to prevent unnecessary database entries/queries
